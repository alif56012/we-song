# vp uses a Rust component that initialises an HTTPS client on every invocation.
# Debian slim (oven/bun base) ships without ca-certificates, which makes
# rustls-native-certs find zero certs and abort immediately.

# --ignore-scripts skips `prepare` (vp config + svelte-kit sync) which needs
# source files that aren't copied yet; the || echo '' fallback already handles
# this, but skipping is cleaner and faster.
